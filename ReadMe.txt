Original data set was obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/ashwinik/consumer-complaints-financial-products?select=Consumer_Complaints.csv

This project was specifically created for Freedom Mortgage. The data set is limited to the information provided by The Consumer Complaint Database. Without more internal data, some conclusions can not be reached. Additionally, time was of the essence, so the depth of the report is limited as well.

This report was created using Tableau and Microsoft Word, then saved as a pdf.  The original data set, Tableau file and Word file are all included.
